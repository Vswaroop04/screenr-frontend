- Prefer **Server Components** whenever possible.
- Always use translations. Place copy in the `messages/*` folder and access it with `next-intl`; avoid hard-coded strings.
- Use **TanStack Query** for all data fetching. When a component needs data, prefetch the query in a Server Component, dehydrate the state, and hydrate it on the client (see `src/app/assesments/page.tsx`).
- Use **React Hook Form** with Zod for forms and validation.
- Before creating a new UI element, check **shadcn/ui**. If a component exists there, reuse it; otherwise add your own component under `src/components/shared`.
- Minimise custom CSS; use Tailwind utilities wherever possible.
- Persist shared client-side state with **Zustand** if necessary.
- Store common colour tokens in `globals.css` using custom properties such as `--brand-blue-1`.
